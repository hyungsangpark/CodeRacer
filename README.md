Welcome to CodeRacer, a type racing game with code blocks.

This is a CS732/SE750 project repository for the group Fearless Frogs.

## Description

CodeRacer enables users to practise the code syntax and familiarise themselves with the frequently
used algorithms by typing a block of code in a timed manner. CodeRacer not only supports

allowing them to gain code-typing experience.
